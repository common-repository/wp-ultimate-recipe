Legacy recipe plugin. Replaced by WP Recipe Maker.

== Description ==

**Important, this plugin is outdated!**

Back in 2016 we released a new recipe plugin called [WP Recipe Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/) that we HIGHLY recommend you to look into instead.

You can still find the old plugin here because we release bug fixes for our existing users, if necessary. But you won't get new features or others improvements anymore [for these reasons](https://help.bootstrapped.ventures/article/61-what-about-wp-ultimate-recipe).

**If you're looking for a new recipe plugin, look at WP Recipe Maker or any of the other modern recipe plugins out there!**

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-ultimate-recipe` directory (directory included) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add recipes using the menu on the left

== Frequently asked questions ==

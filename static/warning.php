    <h1>Warning</h1>

    <p>We do NOT recommend you using our WP Ultimate Recipe plugin anymore. It was a good plugin but in 2016 we launched its successor: <a href="https://bootstrapped.ventures/wp-recipe-maker/" target="_blank">WP Recipe Maker</a>. That's already more than 4 years ago and our new plugin has outgrown WP Ultimate Recipe a long time ago.</p>
    <p>WP Recipe Maker is more performant, has less compatibility problems, is better for SEO, up to the latest standards, fully Gutenberg integrated, and so on. You can <a href="https://help.bootstrapped.ventures/article/61-what-about-wp-ultimate-recipe" target="_blank">learn more about the differences here</a>.</p>
    <p>The plugin you're using right now will not get new features or improvements. It's also not being sold anymore. We will release bug fixes for the time being, but HIGHLY recommend you looking into moving over to WP Recipe Maker as soon as possible. Your <a href="https://help.bootstrapped.ventures/article/96-import-from-wp-ultimate-recipe" target="_blank">recipes can get imported</a> to our new plugin.</p>
